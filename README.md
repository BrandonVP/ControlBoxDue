# ControlBoxDue

This software was initially developed for my junior college project. It is still in active development as my hobby project. The project is a dual robotic arm system that communicates over a CAN Bus network. Each robotic arm is controlled by an Arduino Mega2560 and receives commands from a Arduino Due controller.

This portion of the code runs on the Arduino Due and sends commands to both Mega2560s that control the arm movements. There is another version of this software that runs on a wireless version of the controller.
