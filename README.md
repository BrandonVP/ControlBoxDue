# ControlBoxDue

This project started as my junior college project that I have continued to build on after completing that class. The idea was for a dual arm system that communicated over a CAN Bus network. Each arm is controlled by an Arduino Mega2560 and receives commands from a Arduino Due controller.

This portion of the code runs on the Due and sends commands to both Mega2560s that control the arm movements. Development has slowed as I have focused more on the wireless version of this controller. I am planning to spend time improving this code and converting to non-blocking code in the future.

IDE: I am using visual studios with vMicro plugin 

Hardware:

Custom made enclosure

Arduino Due

Micro SD Card reader

SD Card ribbon extension

CAN Bus transceiver
